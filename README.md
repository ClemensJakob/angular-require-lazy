angular-require-lazy
====================

An example-experimental application for mixing [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/), [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/) and [require-lazy](https://github.com/nikospara/require-lazy).

Changes
-------

- (2017/01/31) A long time has passed... And this project is no longer relevant: Angular has moved to 2 (or 4 or whatever), I have moved away of Angular, AMD is now superseeded by the excellent ES6 modules and Webpack does what I ever wanted this project to do; I will be answering questions and issues as and if they appear, but I doubt there is much point in continuing this project; a big thank you to everyone!
- (2014/10/26) Added support for **test coverage** and [SonarQube](http://www.sonarqube.org/) integration; **documentation** is on the way, do check the [wiki](https://github.com/nikospara/angular-require-lazy/wiki)
- (2014/10/20) Support for true on-demand Angular module loading (i.e. triggered by an action other than route navigation); see `scripts/app/modules/expenses/expensesController` and the `ngLazy` AMD module
- (2014/10/12) **MAJOR** changes for simplification; RequireJS is used strictly for script loading, the `$injector` AMD module is gone
- (2014/10/03) Added support for testing with [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/).
- (2014/03/08) 
    1. Angular's `$injector` is now exposed as AMD module; it is no longer a promise.
    2. Enabled `module.config()` for lazy Angular modules. THIS IS UNTESTED AND EXPERIMENTAL FOR THE TIME BEING.
- (2013/10/24) Changed the framework to be more Angular-like.
- (2013/09/15) Added a lazy directive example, see `scripts/app/modules/categories/category-directive.js`.

Preface
-------

This is an example application for keeping track of personal/family expenses.
This is still work in progress and open for discussion. Its main purpose is to demonstrate the mixing of Angular and require-lazy,
not to be functionally complete, at least at this stage.

Requirements
------------

1. Node.js to run the mock server and the build scripts. The `node` executable must be in `PATH` for the build scripts to work.
2. A browser with decent debugging and network traffic analysis capabilities (e.g. latest Firefox+Firebug).

Run
---

1. Clone the GIT repository
2. `npm instal`
3. `bower install`
4. `node app.js` to run the server
5. Hit `http://localhost:8110/app.html` (this is the unbuilt-development version of the application)

Build, test and run
-------------------

(Steps 1, 2 & 3 above are prerequisites)

(NOTE: There used to be a standalone script based build system; this was deprecated and removed in favor of Grunt.)

### Using Grunt

1. Make sure `grunt-cli` is installed and the `grunt` command is in PATH.
2. `grunt` to compile everything
3. (make sure server is running &rarr; `node app.js`)
4. Hit `http://localhost:8110/app-built.html` (this is the built version of the application)

### Testing (with Karma/Jasmine)

Run `karma start --single-run`.

What happens?
-------------

This application is set up to load only the scripts it needs for the current view. When the view changes, only the scripts necessary
for the new view are loaded.

To observe this behaviour open Firebug to the network tab, then load the unbuilt-development version of the application.
Observe the scripts being loaded: `ng-grid-XXX.js` is not needed and not loaded.
Navigate to the "Expenses" view (top menu). `ng-grid-XXX.js` and the application scripts required for this view are loaded just in time.

The scripts needed for each view are packed together into "bundle" files, when the application is built. So for the expenses view
`app/modules/expenses/main.js`, `app/modules/expenses/expenses-view.js`, `app/modules/expenses/expenses-template.html`, and
`ng-grid-2.0.7-debug.js` are bundled into one script file (i.e. `expenses-built.js`) and the file is loaded with a cache-breaking
hash (something like a `?v=e1974633ea3017db85324f449bc6479f` request parameter). This process is using [r.js](http://requirejs.org/docs/optimization.html)
and [require-lazy](https://github.com/nikospara/require-lazy).

The noteworthy points are:

- AngularJS modules can be lazy loaded. Even pure Angular modules, like the demonstrated case with `ngGrid` (see the "Expenses" view).
- Directives can be lazy loaded too, using the `currentModule` AMD module (see `scripts/app/modules/categories/categoryDirective.js`).
- There is a "module" discovery mechanism: any directory under `app/modules/` that contains a `main.js` script and a `main.metadata.json`
  can automatically appear in the menu (see `build-scripts/discoverModules.js`). This is used both by the build process and by the server.
  The discovery mechanism can be implemented by any server-side technology: you need to auto-generate the `lazy-registry` AMD module.
- The application is split into bundles automatically using `r.js` standard configuration and require-lazy;
  no further configuration is needed.

How?
----

- The providers (e.g. `$controllerProvider`, `$compileProvider`) are captured from a `config` function called from `bootstrap.js`.
  This function is defined in `scripts/lib/angular-require-lazy/lazyAngularUtils.js` (`cacheInternals()`).
- After bootstrapping, we replace Angular's `module()` method with a proxy that can handle lazy loaded modules (see `makeLazyAngular()`
  and `makeLazyModule()` in `scripts/lib/angular-require-lazy/lazyAngularUtils.js`).
- Templates can be loaded as text through a RequireJS plugin (as `"templateCache!path/to/my.html"`) and registered with Angular's
  `$templateCache` with the correct name (here `"path/to/my.html"`).
- The developer uses the lazy loading mechanism by the special AMD module `currentModule`. This is a proxy to the currently loading
  Angular module, providing the familiar API (some methods are still under development).
- See any view module under `WebContent/scripts/app/modules/` to see the implementation of a view; this is the actual code a developer would
  write, i.e. application code, not framework code.

### Testing - Coverage - Sonar

Run `grunt test` to run the test suite.

Run `grunt coverage` to make the test coverage report. The output will be in `build-coverage/report/output/lcov.info`
and the HTML version under `build-coverage/report/output/lcov-report/index.html`.

To have Sonar analyze the project, execute the coverage report first and then, run `sonar-runner` (make
sure it is in the `PATH`).

Why?
----

I believe both RequireJS and AngularJS are very useful libraries/frameworks. I am surprized that Angular does not cooperate
smoothly with RequireJS out of the box, so I have been experimenting with this implementation.

I believe this can be further improved and I hope it will contribute to a solution bridging the worlds of AMD and Angular modules.

The providers capturing technique (implemented in `scripts/lib/angular-require-lazy/lazyAngularUtils.js`)
is based heavily on [angularjs-requirejs-lazy-controllers](https://github.com/matys84pl/angularjs-requirejs-lazy-controllers).
